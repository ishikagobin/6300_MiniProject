## Project Objective

This project examines U.S. airline performance during November 2023, using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
The goal is to evaluate how airlines and airports operated during the start of the busy holiday travel season—focusing on delays, cancellations, and day-to-day flight behavior.

## Key Questions

1. Which airlines and airports demonstrated the strongest reliability?
2. Where did delays or cancellations cluster, and which carriers were most affected?
3. How did broader operational patterns such as weekday demand or holiday travel surges—shape overall performance?
